# Defination
	Flyweight pattern is one of the structural pattern which works when memory optimization is required.
	Another name of flyweight object is cached object.

# Implementation Guidelines
	-If all the objects are having one or more same type of object which takes huge amount of memory.
	-Take out all the intrinsic data from the object and form a Flyweight Object by using intrinsic data.
	-The Flyweight class can be immutable.
	-Extinsic data can be passed to Flyweight object in method parameter.
	-One flyweight object is created, it is cached in memoery to be used later. Factory can be implemented to fetch the flyweight object.





	Example : 
	You don't need to create the sprite for each & evey object (sprite means the picture or image). i.e one image can be used for humanoid & other for dog and same can be used in all object.
	In this game example, image gonna be remain same so we will create flyweight object with all the intrinsic properties & cosume that same object in diffrent objects.
