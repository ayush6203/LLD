# Defination
	It is structural design pattern, in which we write a wrapper/adapter to merge two different/non compatable interfaces.

# Implementatioin Guidelines
	- Suppose there is one Legacy Code, which needs to be consumed by some new set of code.
	- This pattern is client focussed pattern, we want client code to be changed very less.
