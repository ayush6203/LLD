# Defination
	Facade pattern is nothing but a layer of abstraction over a particular service/api.

# Implementation Guidelines
	Where ever you need to perform some steps of action from different services, you can consider creating a facade
	which will perform all the steps one by one.

	it can also be said that adding a layer of abstraction over a service is generally known as facade.

	one more example, suppose there is a library which offers numbers of services, but we need only selected options, what we can do is
	we can create a facade which will internally use the library and user can easily use the facade.

	i.e Zomato is also like a facade, between a user & resturant.

	User -> Resturant
	User -> Zomato -> Resturant.
