# Defination
	Proxy pattern comes into action when you implement an intermediate object into object call.

	client -> studentObj.CreateStudent();     Normal Call
	clinet -> studnetProxyObj.CreateStudent();   Proxy Call

# Implementation Guidelines
	Create a class say student class
	Create an interface which above class will implement.
	Now you are good to go, simply call the class but if you need proxy then,
	Create a proxy concrete class & implement same interface.
	Override, the methods of the interface in proxy, do some stuff & call the actuall object from inside.

# Use Case
	If you want to restrict some action
	If you want to cache
	If you want to do some pre or post processing.
