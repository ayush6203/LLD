# Defination
	It is a creational type of pattern, which allows to create an object step by step.
	ie. If you are creating an object of computer then,
		CPU & Monitor are must, but lightpen, printer these are optional. 
	Builder pattern allows to create these object and assign the availble peripherals on the fly.

	so it would look like, 
		- Create a builder
		- builder.Add(lightpen);
		- builder.Add(printer);
		- builder.build();

		in short, it is similar to StrinBuilder.


# Implenentation Guidelines
	- There are lot of optional properties, (you can't create constructor for all the optional combinations)
	- Use it when you want to append properties one by one or i say outer objects add inner objects step by step.
