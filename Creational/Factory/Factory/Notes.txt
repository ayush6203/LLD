# Defination
	This Pattern provides the best way to create the Objects. 
	In Factory patterns we create the object of the Class without Exposing the Creation/Instantiation 
	Logic to the User who wants to create the Object and then return the newly 
	Created object using the Common Interface which is inherited  by the Class


# Note
	We see that we pass the information about the object to the VehicleFactory which is sometimes known as 
	Parametrized Factory VehicleType which gets the parameter of string type from the main class then after that 
	they check the coming inputs and they create the object and then return to the user.

	This implementation is most easy to create and also useable. 
	But the problem is that let’s say we want to add Truck class; 
	so in the VehcileFactory we change the code to add some new Condition which is sometimes a bad situation, 
	so that’s why we are able to say that “they violate the Open Close Principle.
